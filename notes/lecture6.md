### Convolution Neural Network
- convolutions are applied to different areas of an image
- Multilayer perceptrons for images?
- convolutional neural networks assume that the input is an image which means domain knowledge can be encoded into the architecture
- inductive bias
- receptive fiekd
- stride
- what is a receotive feild
